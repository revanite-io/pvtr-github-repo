// project's current licensing posture. Two release-time hazards drive the
// design (see ossf/pvtr-github-repo-scanner#70):
//
//  1. The license can be modified or removed at the release tag while the
//     default branch still shows an approved one. GitHub's auto-generated
//     source archives contain the tree at the tag, so the authoritative
//     evidence is the license GitHub detects at that tag, not at HEAD. This is
//     checked first and, when conclusive, decides the result outright.
//  2. A license file attached directly to the release can supersede whatever
//     ships inside the source archives, but its content is not observable
//     here. It is treated as corroborating evidence, not a blocker: it never
//     downgrades a tag-level Pass or Fail, and only tips an otherwise
//     inconclusive result toward NeedsReview rather than Failed.
//
// Default-branch evidence is used only as a lower-confidence fallback when
// there is no tag name to check directly. A tag-level lookup that fails
// outright (rather than resolving to found/not-found) is not treated as
// "unavailable" in that sense — see the default case below — because #70's
// whole premise is that HEAD can look licensed while the tag is not.
