    description: |
      Legal focuses on the policies and
      procedures that govern the project's licensing
      and intellectual property. These controls help
      ensure that the project's source code is
      distributed under a recognized and legally
      enforceable open source software license,
      reducing the risk of intellectual property
      disputes or licensing violations.

        title: |
          The version control system MUST require all code contributors to assert
          that they are legally authorized to make the associated contributions
          on every commit.
        objective: |
          Ensure that code contributors are aware of and acknowledge their legal
          responsibility for the contributions they make to the project, reducing
          the risk of intellectual property disputes against the project.

              While active, the version control system MUST require all code
              contributors to assert that they are legally authorized to make the
              associated contributions on every commit.

              - maturity-2
              - maturity-3
            recommendation: |
              Include a DCO in the project's repository, requiring code
              contributors to assert that they are legally authorized to commit the
              associated contributions on every commit. Use a status check to ensure
              the assertion is made. A CLA also satisfies this requirement.
              Some version control systems, such as GitHub, may include this in the
              platform terms of service.

              It is understood that projects with a lengthy history prior to
              adopting OSPS Baseline may not be able to retroactively enforce this
              requirement.

          All licenses for the project MUST meet the OSI Open Source Definition
          or the FSF Free Software Definition.
        objective: |
          Ensure that the project's source code is distributed under a recognized
          and legally enforceable open source software license, providing clarity on
          how the code can be used and shared by others.

            recommendation: |
              Add a LICENSE file to the project's repo with a license that is an
              approved license by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), or a free
              license as approved by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Examples of
              such licenses include the MIT, BSD 2-clause, BSD 3-clause revised,
              Apache 2.0, Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL), and the GNU
              General Public License (GPL). Releasing to the public domain meets
              this control if there are no other encumbrances such as patents.

            recommendation: |
              If a different license is included with released software assets,
              ensure it is an approved license by the Open Source Initiative (OSI),
              or a free license as approved by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
              Examples of such licenses include the MIT, BSD 2-clause, BSD 3-clause
              revised, Apache 2.0, Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL), and the
              GNU General Public License (GPL). Note that the license for the
              released software assets may be different than the source code.

          All licenses for the project's source code MUST be maintained in a
          standard location within the corresponding repository.
        objective: |
          Ensure that the project's source code and released software assets are
          distributed with the appropriate license terms, making it clear to users
          and contributors how each can be used and shared.
