          The project documentation MUST provide design documentation demonstrating
          all actions and actors within the system.
        objective: |
          Provide an overview of the project's design and architecture, illustrating
          the interactions and components of the system to help contributors and
          security reviewers understand the internal logic of the released software
          assets.

              When the project has made a release, the project MUST perform a
              security assessment to understand the most likely and impactful
              potential security problems that could occur within the software.
            applicability:
              - maturity-2
              - maturity-3
            recommendation: |
              Performing a security assessment informs both project members as well
              as downstream consumers that the project understands what problems
              could arise within the software. Understanding what threats could be
              realized helps the project manage and address risk. This information
              is useful to downstream consumers to demonstrate the security acumen
              and practices of the project.

              When the project has made a release, the project MUST perform a threat
              modeling and attack surface analysis to understand and protect against
              attacks on critical code paths, functions, and interactions within the
              system.
            applicability:
              - maturity-3
            recommendation: |
              Threat modeling is an activity where the project looks at the
              codebase, associated processes and infrastructure, interfaces, key
              components and "thinks like a hacker" and brainstorms how the system
              be be broken or compromised. Each identified threat is listed out so
              the project can then think about how to proactively avoid or close off
              any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.
              Ensure this is updated for new features or breaking changes.
