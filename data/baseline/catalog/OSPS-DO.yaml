              When the project has made a release, the project documentation MUST
              include a description of how the project selects, obtains, and tracks
              its dependencies.
            applicability:
              - maturity-2
              - maturity-3
            recommendation: |
              It is recommended to publish this information alongside the project's
              technical & design documentation on a publicly viewable resource such
              as the source code repository, project website, or other channel.
