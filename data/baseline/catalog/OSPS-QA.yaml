    title: Quality
    description: |
      Quality focuses on the processes and
      practices used to ensure the quality and
      reliability of the project's source code and
      software assets. These controls help ensure
      that the project's source code is well
      maintained, secure, and reliable, reducing the
      risk of defects or vulnerabilities in the
      software.

            recommendation: |
              Do not add any unreviewable binary artifacts to the project's version
              control system. This includes executable application binaries, library
              files, and similar artifacts. It does not include assets such as
              graphical images, sound or music files, and similar content typically
              stored in a binary format.

            The project MUST use at least one automated test suite for the source
            code repository.
        objective: |
          Ensure that the project uses at least one automated test suite for the
          source code repository and clearly documents when and how tests are run.

              Prior to a commit being accepted, the project's CI/CD pipelines MUST
              run at least one automated test suite to ensure the changes meet
              expectations.

              - maturity-2

            recommendation: | # give examples
              Automated tests should be run prior to every merge into the primary
              branch. The test suite should be run in a CI/CD pipeline and the
              results should be visible to all contributors. The test suite should
              be run in a consistent environment and should be run in a way that
              allows contributors to run the tests locally.
              Examples of test suites include unit tests, integration tests, and
              end-to-end tests.

              Add a section to the contributing documentation that explains how to
              run the tests locally and how to run the tests in the CI/CD pipeline.
              The documentation should explain what the tests are testing and how to
              interpret the results.

              Add a section to the contributing documentation that explains the

              constitutes a major change and what tests should be added or updated.

              When a commit is made to the primary branch, the project's version
              control system MUST require at least one non-author approval of the
              changes before merging.

            recommendation: |
              Configure the project's version control system to require at least one
              non-author approval of changes before merging into the release or
              primary branch. This can be achieved by requiring a pull request to be
              reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor before it can
              be merged.
