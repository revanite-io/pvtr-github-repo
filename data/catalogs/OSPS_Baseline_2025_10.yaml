      description: |
        The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Badge is a way 
        for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they
        follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify, at no cost,
        by using this web application to explain how they follow each best practice.
        The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges available
        to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which
        FLOSS projects are following best practices and, as a result, are more
        likely to produce higher-quality secure software.

        The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry,
        government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks.
        It offers a taxonomy of high level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used
        by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to
        better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity
        efforts. The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved.
        Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on
        practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes.

        PCI Security Standards are technical and operational requirements
        set by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) to protect cardholder
        data. The standards apply to all entities that store, process or transmit
        cardholder data – with requirements for software developers and manufacturers
        of applications and devices used in those transactions. The Council is
        responsible for managing the security standards, while compliance with the
        PCI set of standards is enforced by the founding members of the Council:
        American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard and Visa Inc.
        The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to all entities that store,
        process, and/or transmit cardholder data. It covers technical and operational
        system components included in or connected to cardholder data. If you accept
        or process payment cards, PCI DSS applies to you.

      description: |
        The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a set of fundamental,
        sound, and secure software development practices based on established
        secure software development practice documents from organizations such as
        BSA, OWASP, and SAFECode. Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models
        explicitly address software security in detail, so practices like those in
        the SSDF need to be added to and integrated with each SDLC implementation.
        Following the SSDF practices should help software producers reduce the
        number of vulnerabilities in released software, reduce the potential impact
        of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and
        address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences. Also,
        because the SSDF provides a common language for describing secure software
        development practices, software producers and acquirers can use it to foster
        their communications for procurement processes and other management activities.

        The Proactive-Software Supply Chain Risk Management (P-SSCRM) Framework is
        designed to help you understand and plan a secure software supply chain risk
        management initiative. P-SSCRM was created through a process of understanding
        and analyzing real-world data from nine industry-leading software supply chain
        risk management initiatives as well as through the analysis and unification
        of ten government and industry documents, frameworks, and standards. Although
        individual methodologies and standards differ, many initiatives and standards
        share common ground. P-SSCRM describes this common ground and presents a model
        for understanding, quantifying, and developing a secure software supply chain
        risk management program and determining where your organization's existing
        efforts stand when contrasted with other real-world software supply chain
        risk management initiatives.

        This voluntary Software Security Code of Practice has been developed to
        improve the security and resilience of software that organisations and

        The Software Security Code of Practice will support software vendors and
        their customers in reducing the likelihood and impact of software supply
        chain attacks and other software resilience incidents. Often, these kinds
        of attacks and disruptions are caused by avoidable weaknesses in software
        development and maintenance practices. The impact of these kinds of incidents
        can also be exacerbated by poor communication between organisations and
        their software suppliers. This Code addresses those issues.

      Build and Release focuses on the processes and
      tools used to compile, package, and distribute the
      project's software. These controls help ensure that the
      project's build and release pipelines are secure,
      consistent, and reliable, reducing the risk of
      vulnerabilities or errors in the software distribution
      process.

              a descriptive log of functional and security
              modifications.
            applicability:
              - Maturity Level 2
              - Maturity Level 3
            recommendation: |
              Ensure that all releases include a descriptive change log. It is
              recommended to ensure that the change log is human-readable and
              includes details beyond commit messages, such as descriptions of the
              security impact or relevance to different use cases. To ensure
              machine readability, place the content under a markdown header
              such as "## Changelog".

              Automated tests should be run prior to every merge into the primary
              branch. The test suite should be run in a CI/CD pipeline and the
              results should be visible to all contributors. The test suite should
              be run in a consistent environment and should be run in a way that
              allows contributors to run the tests locally.
              Examples of test suites include unit tests, integration tests, and
              end-to-end tests.

    description: |
      Vulnerability Management focuses on the
      processes and practices used to identify and
      address security vulnerabilities in the project's
      software dependencies. These controls help ensure
      that the project is well positioned to respond to
      security threats and vulnerabilities in the software.

              automatically evaluated against a documented policy for malicious
              dependencies and known vulnerabilities in dependencies, then blocked
              in the event of violations, except when declared and suppressed as
              non-exploitable.

              - Maturity Level 3
            recommendation: |
              Create a status check in the project's version control system that
              runs a Software Composition Analysis tool on all changes
              to the codebase. Require that the status check passes before changes
              can be merged.

        title: |
          The project documentation MUST enforce a policy that defines a
          threshold for remediation of SAST findings.
        objective: |
          Identify and address defects and security weaknesses in the project's
          codebase early in the development process, reducing the risk of shipping
          insecure software.
